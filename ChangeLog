Version 0.1.1
	- fixed segm fault when calling PX_get_record()

Version 0.1.0
	- New function PX_get_record2() which has two extra parameter.
	  One to enable reading of deleted records and one to return
		internal data about the data block from which the record has
		been read.
	- added pxh->theonumrecords which is the number of records which
	  theoretically fit into all data blocks. This number can be
		much bigger that the number of records in the header. Also
		increases the max. record number to theonumrecords
		when reading a record.
	- DB files can contain many more records than the number of records
	  in the header. The remaining records are left overs, which were
		deleted but not removed from the file. pxlib can now handle those
		files.
